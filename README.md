# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow

Welcome to my repository for the code examples and exercises from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron. This repository is organized chapter-wise, and each chapter contains the corresponding code and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Structure:

    Each chapter has its own folder containing Python notebooks and any relevant data files.
    Notebooks are organized to guide you through the concepts and code examples.

## Goals:

    Solidify my understanding of machine learning concepts.
    Improve my practical skills with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow.
    Create a resource for others learning from the same book.

## Acknowledgements:

    I am grateful to Aurélien Géron for writing this excellent book.
    I also appreciate the contributions of the open-source community, which has made these tools and resources available.
